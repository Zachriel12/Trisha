            This graph, based on the comparison of atmospheric samples 
            contained in ice cores and more recent direct measurements, 
            provides evidence that atmospheric CO2 has increased since the 
            Industrial Revolution. (Credit: Luthi, D., et al.. 2008;

            Direct observations made on and above the Earth's surface
            reveal that the planet's climate is changing dramatically.
            Human activity is the major cause of these changes.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Earth’s climate has altered over time. There have been
            seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat in the last 
            650,000 years, with the abrupt end of the last ice age 
            approximately 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of 
            the current climatic era — and human civilization. The 
            majority of these climatic shifts are linked to minute 
            fluctuations in Earth's orbit that alter the quantity of 
            solar energy our planet gets.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The current warming trend is particularly notable since
            it is undoubtedly the consequence of human activity since
            the mid-twentieth century and is occurring at an
            unprecedented rate spanning millennia. Human activities
            have undeniably warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land,
            as well as caused extensive and fast changes in the atmosphere,
            ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere.

        <div class="sub-head1">EVIDENCE FOR RAPID CHANGES:</div>
        <div class="sub-head2">1. GLOBAL TEMPERATURE RISE</div>

        <p class="paragraph">
        Since the late 1800s, the average surface temperature of the Earth has 
        risen by roughly 2.12 degrees Fahrenheit (1.18 degrees Celsius), owing 
        primarily to rising carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and 
        other human activities. The majority of the warming has happened in the 
        last 40 years, with the most recent seven years being the hottest. 2016 
        and 2020 are tied as the hottest years on record.

        <div class="sub-head2">2. WARMING OCEAN</div>
        <p class="paragraph">The ocean has absorbed much of the extra heat, with 
            the top 100 meters (328 feet) of water rising by more than 0.6 degrees 
            Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969. The oceans hold 90 percent 
            of the excess energy on Earth.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The bulk of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has 
            shrunk. Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice each year 
            between 1993 and 2019, according to NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate 
            Experiment data, while Antarctica lost around 148 billion tons of ice per year.</p>

            and that the snow is melting sooner.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Over the previous century, the global sea-level rise 
            by roughly 8 inches (20 cm). The rate in the recent two decades, on 
            the other hand, is over double that of the previous century and is 
            increasing somewhat each year.</p>

            Since 1950, the number of record hot temperature events in the United 
            States has increased while the number of record low-temperature events 
            has decreased. The United States has also seen an increase in the number 
            of severe rainfall events

        <div class="sub-head2">9. OCEAN ACIDIFICATIONS</div>
        <p class="last-paragraph">
            According to NOOA, the acidity of surface ocean waters has grown by 
            roughly 30% since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. This 
            rise is due to people emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, 
            which is then absorbed by the ocean. In recent decades, the ocean has 
            absorbed between 20% and 30% of total human carbon dioxide emissions (
            7.2 to 10.8 billion metric tons per year).

            seawater with varying levels of dissolved CO2 is pumped from the
