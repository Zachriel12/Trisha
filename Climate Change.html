        <p class="sub-head1">To Undestand Climate Change, you must first understand what climate is.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            You may be familiar with the term "weather." The shifts we see and experience outside 
            from day to day are referred to as weather. It may rain one day and then be bright the 
            next. It becomes chilly at times. It becomes heated at times. The weather also varies 
            from one location to another. In one location, people may be wearing shorts and playing 
            outside. People far away, maybe shoveling snow at the same moment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Climate refers to a location's typical weather. The climate might vary depending on 
            the season. In the summer, a location may be generally warm and dry. In the winter, 
            the same location may be cold and damp. Climates can differ from one location to the 
            next. You could live in an area where it snows all the time. And other individuals live 
            in areas where the water is always warm enough to swim in!

        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">
            There's also Earth's climate to consider. The Earth's climate is the result of combining all of the world's climates.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Climate change is defined as a change in a location's normal weather pattern. 
            This might be due to a shift in the amount of rain that a location typically receives 
            in a year. It might also represent a shift in a location's normal temperature for a month or season.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Climate change refers to changes in the Earth's climate. This might be due to a 
            shift in the average temperature of the Earth. It might also represent a shift in 
            where rain and snow normally fall on Earth.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            The weather may change in a few hours. Climate change can take hundreds or even 
            millions of years. There's also Earth's climate to consider. The Earth's climate 
            is the result of combining all of the world's climates.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Climate change refers to a long-term shift in the average circumstances of a region, 
            such as a temperature and rainfall. NASA scientists have discovered that the Earth's surface is warming, with many of the hottest years on record occurring in the last 20 years. 
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Global climate change refers to long-term average changes throughout the whole planet. 
            These include rising temperatures and precipitation changes, as well as the impacts of global warmings, such as:<br>

        <P class="paragraph">
            Even before humans were on the scene, the Earth's climate was shifting. However, 
            scientists have recently noticed unexpected alterations. For example, over the last 150 years,
             the average temperature of the Earth has risen significantly faster than expected.

        <p class="paragraph">
            The climate of the Earth is always changing. There have been moments when the climate on 
            Earth was warmer than it is now. There have been instances when the weather has been milder. 
            These epochs can continue for thousands or even millions of years.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            People who research the Earth's climate see that it is warming. In the previous 100 years, 
            the Earth's temperature has risen by roughly one degree Fahrenheit. This may not appear to 
            be much. Small variations in the Earth's temperature, on the other hand, can have large consequences.

        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Some impacts are already evident. Some snow and ice have melted as the Earth's temperature has warmed. 
            Oceans have also risen as a result of global warming. It has also altered the time when certain plants develop.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Some regions of the planet are warming faster than others. However, global air temperatures near the Earth's 
            surface have risen by roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit on average during the last century. Indeed, the last five years 
            have been the hottest in millennia.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Many individuals, including scientists, are worried about global warming. The intensity and volume of rainfall during
            storms such as hurricanes are predicted to grow as the Earth's temperature continues to warm. Droughts and heatwaves will
            also grow more severe as the climate warms.
        </p>

        <p class="last-paragraph">
            When the global temperature increases by one or two degrees, it can have a significant influence on the health of the 
            planet's flora and animals.
