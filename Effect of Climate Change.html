        <p class="paragraph">The effects of human-caused global warming are already occurring, 
            are irreversible on the timeframe of individuals living today, and will intensify in 
            the next decades.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="paragraph">Global climate change is already having an impact on the environment. 
            Glaciers have reduced, ice on rivers and lakes is melting earlier, plant and animal ranges 
            have altered, and trees are blooming earlier.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="paragraph">Scientists projected that global climate change will result in the following 
            effects: loss of sea ice, rapid sea-level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="paragraph">Scientists are confident that global temperatures will continue to rise for 
            decades to come, owing in major part to greenhouse gases emitted by human activity. 
            The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes over 1,300 scientists 
            from the United States and other countries, predicts a 2.5 to 10 degree Fahrenheit temperature 
            rise over the next century.

        <div class="sub-head2">FUTURE EFFECTS:</div>
        <div class="list-2">
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Change Will Continue Through This Century and Beyond:</span> 
                    The global climate is expected to alter more during the next century and beyond. The magnitude 
                    of climate change in the coming decades is mostly determined by the amount of heat-trapping 
                    gases generated globally and the sensitivity of the Earth's climate to those emissions</li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Temperature Will Continue To Rise:</span> 
                    Because human-caused warming is being placed on a naturally changing climate, 
                    temperature rises have not been and will not be uniform or smooth across the 
                    country or over time.</li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Frost-free Season (and Growing Season) will Lengthen:</span> 
                    Since the 1980s, the length of the frost-free season (and thus the corresponding growing season)
                     has been increasing nationally, with the greatest increases occurring in the western United States,
                     harming ecosystems and agriculture. The growing season is expected to prolong more over the United 
                     States. In the event that heat-trapping gas emissions continue to rise, the lengths of the frost-free 
                     and growing seasons are expected to extend by a month or more across most of the United States by the 
                     end of the century, with slightly smaller increases in the northern Great Plains. The western United 
                     States will experience the greatest increases in frost-free season (more than eight weeks), particularly 
                     in high elevation and coastal areas. If heat-trapping gas emissions are reduced, the increases will be 
                     much smaller.</li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes in Precipitation Patterns:</span> 
                    Precipitation in the United States has grown on average since 1900, however 
                    certain places have had bigger increases than the national average, while 
                    others have seen losses. Over the next century, the northern United States 
                    will receive more winter and spring precipitation, while the Southwest will 
                    receive less. Future climate projections for the United States indicate that 
                    the existing trend of increased heavy precipitation occurrences will continue. 
                    Even in locations where overall precipitation is likely to decline, such as the 
                    Southwest, this pattern is expected to continue.</li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">More Droughts and Heat Waves:</span> 
                    Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of exceptionally hot 
                    weather lasting days to weeks) are expected to become more strong, while 
                    cold waves will become less intense. Summer temperatures are expected to 
                    rise further, and soil moisture will be reduced, exacerbating heat waves 
                    across much of the western and central United States. What were formerly 
                    once-in-a-century intense heat days (one-day events) are expected to occur 
                    every two or three years throughout much of the country by the end of this 
                    century.</li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More 
                    Intense:</span> Since the early 1980s, the intensity, frequency, and duration 
                    of North Atlantic storms, as well as the frequency of the strongest 
                    (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased. The proportional contributions 
                    of natural and human factors to these increases are still unknown. Hurricane-related 
                    storm intensity and rainfall rates are expected to rise as the climate warms.</li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sea Level Will Rise 1-8 feet by 2100:</span> 
                    Since reliable record-keeping began in 1880, the global sea level has risen by 
                    around 8 inches. By 2100, it is expected to rise another 1 to 8 feet. This is 
                    due to the addition of water from melting land ice as well as the expansion of 
                    seawater as it warms. Storm surges and high tides, combined with sea-level rise 
                    and land subsidence, have the potential to exacerbate floods in many areas over 
                    the next several decades. Because the oceans take a long time to adjust to warmer 
                    temperatures at the Earth's surface, sea-level rise will continue past 2100. 
                    As a result, ocean waters will continue to warm and sea levels will rise at rates 
                    comparable to or greater than those observed in the current century for many centuries.</li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Arctic Likely to Become Ice-Free:</span> 
                    The Arctic Ocean is predicted to be ice-free in the summer by mid-century.</li>
