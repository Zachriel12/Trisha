            WHY IS CLIMATE CHANGE HAPPENING?
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Human actions (most notably the usage of fossil fuels) have significantly 
            increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere, 
            therefore warming the planet. Without human involvement, natural forces 
            would push our world into a cooling phase.
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">Scientists ascribe the observed global warming trend from the 
            mid-twentieth century to human expansion of the "greenhouse effect" â€“ warming 
            caused by the atmosphere trapping heat radiated from Earth into space.</p>
            <br>

        <p class="paragraph">Some gases in the atmosphere prevent heat from escaping. 
            Long-lived gases that remain in the atmosphere semi-permanently and do not 
            respond physically or chemically to temperature changes are referred to as 
            "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, that respond physically 
            or chemically to temperature changes are referred to as "feedback".</p>
            <br>

        <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:</p>
        <img src="images/weather 15.png" id="picture-1">
        <br>

        <p class="paragraph"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. WATER VAPOR</span>: It is the most 
            prevalent greenhouse gas, but it also serves as feedback to the climate. As the Earth's 
            atmosphere warms, water vapor rises, but so does the probability of clouds and precipitation, 
            making these two of the most significant feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="paragraph"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. CARBON DIOXIDE</span>: Carbon dioxide, a minor 
            but extremely essential component of the atmosphere, is emitted by natural processes such as 
            respiration and volcano eruptions, as well as by human activity like deforestation, land-use changes, 
            and the combustion of fossil fuels. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, humans have raised 
            the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by 48%. This is the most significant long-term "force" of 
            climate change.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="paragraph"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. METHANE</span>: A hydrocarbon gas generated by both 
            natural and human causes, such as waste decomposition in landfills, agriculture, particularly rice 
            cultivation, and ruminant digestion and manure management linked with domestic cattle. Methane is a 
            considerably more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide molecule for molecule, but it is also far 
            less prevalent in the atmosphere.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="paragraph"><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. NITROUS OXIDE</span>: A potent greenhouse gas created 
            by soil cultivation techniques, particularly the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, as well as 
            fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid generation, and biomass burning.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="paragraph"><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. CHLOROFLOUROCARBONS</span>: Synthetic chemicals of 
            completely industrial origin utilized for a variety of purposes, but currently mainly controlled in the 
            manufacture and release to the atmosphere due to their ability to contribute to ozone layer depletion 
            by international agreement. They also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="paragraph">Human actions on Earth are altering the natural greenhouse effect. 
            The use of fossil fuels such as coal and oil has raised the concentration of carbon 
            dioxide in the atmosphere during the last century (CO2). This occurs as a result of the 
            coal or oil burning process, which mixes carbon with oxygen in the air to produce CO2. 
            To a lesser extent, land clearance for agriculture, industry, and other human activities 
            has boosted greenhouse gas concentrations.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="paragraph">The consequences of changing the natural atmospheric greenhouse are 
            difficult to predict, but some effects seem likely:
        </p>
        <div class="list-2">
            <ul>
                <li>On average, the Earth will warm. Warmer temperatures may be welcomed in certain areas, but not in others</li>
                <li>Warmer temperatures will almost certainly result in increased evaporation and precipitation overall, but particular locations may differ, with some being wetter and others dryer.</li>
                <li>Increased greenhouse gas emissions will warm the ocean and partially melt glaciers and ice sheets, rising sea levels. Warming ocean water will also expand, adding to increased sea-level rise.</li>
                <li>Higher amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) can have both good and negative effects on crop yields outside of a greenhouse. Some laboratory tests indicate that increased CO2 levels can boost plant growth. Other variables, however, such as shifting temperatures, ozone, and water and nutrient limitations, may more than offset any possible gain in production. If optimum temperature ranges for particular crops are surpassed, prior potential production improvements may be diminished or reversed entirely.</li>
                <li>Climate extremes, such as droughts, floods, and excessive temperatures, can cause crop losses and jeopardize agricultural producers' livelihoods as well as global food security. Weeds, bugs, and fungi can thrive in warmer temperatures, wetter climates, and higher CO2 levels, depending on the crop and habitat, and climate change will likely increase weeds and pests.</li>
                <li>Finally, while increased CO2 levels can boost plant growth, research has revealed that they can also reduce the nutritional value of most food crops by lowering protein and key mineral concentrations in most plant species. Climate change can result in the emergence of new pest and disease patterns, affecting plants, animals, and humans and creating new threats to food security, food safety, and human health.</li>
