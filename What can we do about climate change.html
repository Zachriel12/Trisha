            WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE
        </div>
        <img src="images/weather 16.png" id="picture-1">
        <p class="paragraph">
            The first thing that springs to mind when we hear the term climate change is global warming. 
            Climate change is caused by global warming. In layman's terms, climate change is a change in 
            weather patterns that can endure for a long time, even millions of years. As previously said, 
            climate change is produced by a variety of variables, one of which is global warming.
        </p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">
            The melting of glaciers and the rise in sea level are the most noticeable climate changes. 
            Antarctica no longer has as many ice caps as it did a few decades ago. Do you know that major 
            cities such as New York, Sydney, and Mumbai are in risk of being swamped in the future as sea levels rise?
        </p>
        <br>

        <img src="images/weather 17.png" id="picture-1">
        <p class="paragraph">
            The immensity of global warming can be both intimidating and disheartening. What can a single 
            person, or even a single country, do to delay and reverse climate change? Climate change is 
            occurring right now, and it is the most serious threat to life on Earth. Fortunately, there 
            are numerous climate change remedies that are well understood.
        </p>

        <div class="sub-head2">FOREGO FOSSIL FUELS </div>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The first problem is to cut out the use of coal, oil, and, eventually, natural gas. 
            This is likely the most difficult task because people in affluent countries practically eat, 
            wear, work, play, and even sleep on things manufactured from fossilized sunlight. And inhabitants 
            of developing countries demand and, in some ways, deserve the same conveniences, which are made 
            possible in large part by the energy stored in such fuels.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Oil is the global economy's lubricant, buried in everyday commodities like plastic 
            and corn, and essential to the transportation of both consumers and goods. Coal is the substrate, 
            supplying almost half of the electricity used in the United States and nearly as much globally—a 
            number that, according to the International Energy Agency, is projected to expand. There are no 
            ideal options for reducing reliance on fossil fuels (for example, carbon neutral biofuels can raise 
            food prices and cause forest devastation, and while nuclear power does not generate greenhouse gases, 
            it does produce radioactive waste), but every little bit helps.
        </p>

        <div class="sub-head2">INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADE</div>
        <p class="paragraph">Buildings emit almost one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, despite 
            the fact that investing in greater insulation and other cost-effective temperature-regulating measures 
            might save money in the long run. Electric networks are at or near capacity, yet electricity consumption 
            continues to climb. And even the most fuel-efficient vehicle can suffer from poor road conditions. 
            Investing in new infrastructure or significantly upgrading existing roadways and transmission lines 
            would assist to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also driving economic growth in developing 
            countries.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Of course, new buildings and roads require a lot of cement, which is a big source of 
            greenhouse gas emissions. In 2005, the United States alone produced 50.7 million metric tons of CO2 to 
            the environment from cement manufacture, which requires heating limestone and other ingredients to 1,450 
            degrees Celsius (2,642 degrees Fahrenheit). Copper and other materials required for electrical wiring and 
            transmission are mined, which contributes to global warming pollution.
        </p>

        <div class="sub-head2">MOVE CLOSER TO WORK</div>
        <p class="paragraph">In the United States, transportation is the second largest source of greenhouse gas 
            emissions (burning a single gallon of gasoline produces 20 pounds of CO2). But this does not have to 
            be the case. Moving closer to work, taking public transportation, or switching to walking, cycling, or 
            any form of transportation that does not require anything other than human energy are all ways to 
            significantly reduce transportation fuel needs. Working from home and telecommuting multiple days a 
            week is also a possibility.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Reduced long-distance travel would also aid, particularly plane flights, which are one 
            of the fastest rising sources of greenhouse gas emissions and, arguably, release such emissions in the 
            worst conceivable location (higher in the atmosphere). Flights are also one of the few sources of global 
            warming pollution for which there is no feasible alternative: jets rely on kerosene since it has the 
            highest energy per pound, allowing them to travel far and fast, but it takes around 10 gallons of oil 
            to generate one gallon of JetA fuel. Restricting flying to only critical, long-distance excursions—trains 
            can replace planes for short- to medium-distance flights in many regions of the world—would help reduce 
            airplane emissions.
        </p>

        <div class="sub-head2">CONSUME LESS</div>
        <p class="paragraph">The simplest strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to just buy less goods. 
            Cutting back on consumption, whether by not driving or using a reusable grocery bag, leads in fewer 
            fossil fuels being consumed to extract, produce, and ship things around the world. When making purchases, 
            consider the environment. For example, if you're in the market for a new car, choose one that will last 
            the longest and have the least environmental impact. As a result, a used vehicle with a hybrid powertrain 
            provides improved long-term fuel efficiency while reducing the environmental impact of new car 
            manufacturing. Buying in bulk for necessities like groceries, on the other hand, can limit the quantity of 
            packaging—plastic wrapping, cardboard boxes, and other needless materials. Buying more often implies 
            consuming less.
        </p>

        <div class="sub-head2">BE EFFICIENT</div>
        <p class="paragraph">Doing more with less might have a possibly simpler and even larger impact. 
            Many developed-world citizens waste energy, whether it's through driving in a gas-guzzling sport-utility 
            vehicle or leaving lights on while they're not in a room. Appropriate driving—and good car maintenance, 
            such as making sure tires are properly inflated—can limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced 
            by a vehicle and, probably more crucially, reduce the frequency with which payments are made at the petrol pump
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Similarly, using more efficient refrigerators, air conditioners, and other equipment, such as 
            those rated highly under the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program, can lower energy 
            expenses, while weatherproofing a home's windows can reduce heating and cooling bills. Such efforts can also be put 
            to good use at work, such as constructing more efficient turbines at the power plant or shutting off the lights when 
            you leave the workplace.
        </p>

        <div class="sub-head2">STOP CUTTING DOWN TREES</div>
        <p class="paragraph">Every year, 33 million acres of forest are deforested. Timber harvesting alone contributes 1.5 billion 
            metric tons of carbon to the environment in the tropics. This accounts for 20% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions 
            and is a source that may be avoided quite easily.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Improved farming methods, as well as paper recycling and forest management—balancing the amount of wood 
            removed with the number of new trees growing—could soon reduce this substantial portion of emissions.
        </p>   

        <p class="paragraph">When buying wood products, such as furniture or flooring, buy old or, failing that, wood certified to have 
            been harvested in a sustainable manner. The Amazon and other forests are not only the earth's lungs; they may also represent 
            humanity's best hope for controlling climate change in the short run.
        </p>

        <div class="sub-head2">UNPLUG</div>
        <p class="paragraph">Believe it or not, Americans spend more money on electricity to power items while they are turned off than 
            they do when they are turned on. Televisions, stereo equipment, computers, battery chargers, and a slew of other electronics 
            and appliances use more energy when they appear to be turned off, so unplug them instead.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">Purchasing energy-efficient appliances can help save both energy and money, preventing additional greenhouse 
            gas emissions. For example, efficient battery chargers might save more than one billion kilowatt-hours of electricity—$100 
            million at today's electricity prices—and thereby avoid the release of more than one million metric tons of greenhouse gases.
        </p>


        <div class="sub-head2">CONTROL POPULATION</div>
        <p class="paragraph">Yes, if the population is under control, climate change may be under control as well. 
            How? To put it another way, more people equals greater demand for resources such as food, shelter, and so 
            on, which leads to increased use or utilization of the globe. In some ways, an increase in the number of 
            people contributes to climate change. You've probably heard of China's one-child policy. The world's most 
            populous country has made it a stringent requirement to have only one child. This policy definitely reduces 
            the consumption of resources. Climate change has had a significant impact on China, as the cities are 
            engulfed in haze for the most of the year.
        </p>
        

        <div class="sub-head2">FOCUS ON RENEWABLE ENERGY</div>
        <p class="paragraph">Fossil fuels will be depleted in a few decades, and it is past time to transition to 
            renewable energy. Changing our primary energy sources to clean and renewable energy is the most effective 
            strategy to phase out the use of fossil fuels. Many towns throughout the world are relying on renewable 
            energy sources such as wind, solar, tidal, and ocean energy, among others.
